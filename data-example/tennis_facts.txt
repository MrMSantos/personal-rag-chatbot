101 Fun Facts & Statistics About Tennis
Without further ado, here are the facts. Be sure to leave comments and questions using the form below.

#1 Tennis dates back to 12th century France
Historians think the game originated in northern France in the 12th century, when a ball was struck with the palm of the hand. Louis X of France was an avid player of jeu de paume (“game of the palm”), which evolved into actual tennis, and is credited with being the first to build modern indoor tennis courts.

Because Louis disliked playing tennis outside, he had indoor, covered courts built in Paris near the end of the 13th century.[1]

#2 Only two major rules changes since the 19th century
Since the 1890s, the rules of contemporary tennis have remained mostly unchanged. The server was required to maintain one foot on the ground at all times until 1961 and the tiebreak was adopted in the 1970s.


Electronic review equipment combined with a point-challenge system, known as Hawk-Eye, is a new innovation to professional tennis. It enables a player to argue the line call of a point.[1]

#3 Tennis balls were originally made with feathers wrapped in strips of cloth
Originally, tennis balls were constructed of textile strips, sewn together with thread, and filled with feathers. Modern tennis balls are comprised of felt-coated hollow vulcanized rubber. Originally white, the prevailing color was progressively altered to optic yellow in the late 20th century to increase visibility.[1]

#4 Singles play tennis on a 27-foot wide court and doubles on 36 feet
Tennis is a sport that takes place on a rectangular, flat surface. For singles matches, the court is 78 feet (23.77 m) long and 27 feet (8.2 m) wide; for doubles matches, it is 36 feet (11 m). In order for players to reach overrun balls, there is additional open space surrounding the court.[1]

#5 The oldest tennis court in the world is still played on today
Between 1526 and 1529, Cardinal Wolsey had the first tennis court erected at Hampton Court Palace.

Henry VIII was a brilliant tennis player when he was younger, spending hours on the court. When his second wife Anne Boleyn was seized and transported to the Tower of London, she was betting on a game of tennis. She even complained about not being able to receive her prize!

Since 1625, when this one was erected for Charles I, there has been a tennis court on this spot. Three of the court’s current walls date from the 17th century, while the fourth was built by Cardinal Wolsey himself.[2]

#6 A clock face is believed to be the inspiration for tennis’ scoring system
It’s been suggested that clock faces were used to keep score on the court, with a quarter motion of the minute hand indicating a score of 15, 30, or 45. The game ended when the hand reached 60.

The concept of “deuce” was added to guarantee that the game could not be won by a one-point differential in player scores. The 45 was altered to 40 to keep the score inside the “60” ticks on the clock face. As a result, if both players have 40 points, the first person to score receives 10 points, bringing the clock to 50. If the player scores a second time before the opponent, they are rewarded with an additional 10 points and the clock is reset to 60 seconds.

The number 60 denotes the finish of the game. If a player fails to score twice in a row, the clock will reset to 40 and a new “deuce” will be established.[3]

#7 In 1972, yellow tennis balls were introduced for the first time

The athlete that was rated number one had an annual pay of $14,406,932 on average, while players placed number 1,927 received only $1,126 per year.[48]

#72 US Open ball boys/girls were paid $11 per hour in 2017
Although serving as a ballperson at the US Open is entirely voluntary, in most cases, individuals who do so are compensated with an hourly rate of around $11.[49]

#73 The ATP Tour Masters 1000 is comprised of nine tournaments
At the moment, the ATP Masters 1000 consists of the nine tournaments: the Canadian Open (which takes place annually in either Montreal or Toronto), the Italian Open (which takes place in Rome), the Indian Wells Masters, the Miami Open, the Monte-Carlo Masters, the Madrid Open, the Cincinnati Masters, the Shanghai Masters, and the Paris Masters. Since 2009, all but one of the events have been played on outdoor hard courts, while the remaining three have been played on clay, and the last one has been played on an indoor hard court. Prior to 2009, there were only two indoor tournaments at the top-nine level.

When the Madrid Open moved to clay courts in 2009, it took the place of the Hamburg Open in the spring clay court season. This meant that the Shanghai Masters took over the eighth spot in the year, which had previously been occupied by the Madrid Open, which had been held as an indoor event up until that point. Despite the fact that the venue has a roof that can be retracted in case of inclement weather and that it served as the indoor location for the ATP Finals from 2005 through 2008, the Shanghai Masters is officially held outdoors.[50]

#74 Tennis produces higher endurance capacity than bikeriding and jogging
While conducting single longitudinal research, 38 sedentary, middle-aged volunteers were randomly allocated to one of four groups: biking (9), tennis (10), running (9), and a control (10). For 20 weeks, each group exercised three times each week for 30 minutes. Tennis provided an increase in endurance capacity by 5.7 percent, as compared to cycling (14.8 percent) and running (13.3 percent). The control group remained unchanged. However, it should be noted that the duration of each training session was only 30 to 50 percent of the average time players spend playing tennis.[51]

#75 Tennis is excellent for improving cardiovascular health
Because tennis matches can take up to three hours, muscle endurance and aerobic system health are highly impacted. People who play tennis on a regular basis have been proven to have decreased incidences of cardiovascular disease, such as hypertension and coronary artery disease.

Adults’ resting heart rates range from 60 to 100 beats per minute, and a lower heart rate indicates that a person’s heart is working more effectively and that their overall cardiovascular health is improving.

At the height of his career, Bjorn Borg, one of the all-time great tennis players, had a resting heart rate of 35 beats per minute! This was the astounding effect of years of tennis training’s cardiovascular adaptation.[52]

#76 The fuzz on tennis balls slows it down and aids with control
The fuzz on a tennis ball improves wind resistance, slowing the ball down and allowing players to volley for longer. Without it, a lot of serves would result in the ball flying off the court. When players strike the ball, the fuzz helps them control it by keeping it attached to their racquet strings for a millisecond or two longer.[53]

#77 Tennis for Two, introduced in 1958, is believed to be the very first video game
Visitors stood in line at Brookhaven National Laboratory more than fifty years ago, before arcades or home video games, to play “Tennis for Two,” an electronic tennis game that is a predecessor of the today’s video games.

On October 18, 1958, at one of the Lab’s annual visitors’ days, Tennis for Two was first demonstrated. The electronic tennis game was played by two individuals using separate controllers coupled to an analog computer with an oscilloscope as a screen. William Higinbotham, the game’s developer, was a nuclear scientist who served as the first chair of the Federation of American Scientists, which advocated for nuclear nonproliferation.[54]

#82 Since 2007, wheelchair tennis is played at all four Grand Slam events
Since 2007, wheelchair tennis has been competed at all four Grand Slams and is one of the summer Paralympic sports. There are singles and doubles events in each of the three categories: Men, Women, and Quads.

The Quad division, which is the newest, is for players who have significant loss of function in at least one upper limb, but this can involve a variety of infirmities other than quadriplegia. During the Paralympic Games, the division is commonly referred to as Mixed. Quad players sometimes tape their rackets to their hands to compensate for their loss of function, and some players are permitted to utilize motorized wheelchairs.[58]

#83 There are two different wheelchair tennis categories at the Olympics
Wheelchair tennis athletes at the olympics are split into two groups:

“Open”: athletes with lower limb impairment.

“Quad”: athletes with both upper and lower limb impairment.[72]

#84 Professional tennis players opt for 27- to 29-inch rackets
In terms of length, junior rackets typically vary from 21 to 26 inches (53 to 66 cm), with 27 inches (69 cm) reserved for stronger, more physically developed players. Some are also available at 27.5 to 29-inch lengths (70 to 74 cm). The Gamma Big Bubba was formerly available in a 32-inch (81-centimeter) length, but that length is no longer authorized.[59]

#85 Tennis rackets weigh seven ounces unstrung and about 12.6 ounces strung
Racket weights range from seven ounces (200 g) unstrung to 12.6 ounces (360 g) strung. Rackets with a “medium” weight were made until the 1980s. During the peak of the wood period (e.g. the 1960s), “Heavy” rackets were made in small quantities. Since it was abandoned by businesses, the “medium” weight is heavier than any of the rackets manufactured. To increase stability, several pros added weight to their rackets.[59]

#86 The word ‘tennis’ is searched approximately 368,000 times per month in the United States

#87 There are an estimated 250,000 tennis courts in the United States
According to the latest figures from the United States Tennis Association, the country has an estimated 250,000 tennis courts to serve the country’s 20+ million tennis players. Even in such a large and wide country as the United States, a number of those courts will wind up in strange locations.

So don’t be shocked if you see one in Grand Central Terminal or on the ledges of Alcatraz. In Brooklyn, a clay court may be found buried among housing complexes. Or one fashioned out of an Iowa family farm. Naturally, that’s a grass court.

You may try tennis at the International Tennis Hall of Fame or on the same courts as the Williams sisters. Alternatively, you may live near to an oil field in Texas or on the beaches of Lake George. And you won’t have to break the bank to play them. The majority of the courts on this list are open to the public.[61]

#89 Tennis racket sales were up 40 percent in 2020

#90 97.7 percent of players surveyed reported that tennis helps manage health
When asked if practicing tennis helps them manage their health, 97.7 percent of respondents said yes. Even with such a wide, heterogeneous sample of athletes, this overwhelming majority demonstrates the beneficial influence that playing a sport at any level may have on a player’s well-being.[63]

#88 In 2021, 22.62 million people took to the tennis courts

Nearly 3 million were first-time gamers, representing a 44 percent increase over new players in 2019. In addition, the 3.82 million Americans who returned to the sport after a break was up 40% from the same figure in 2019.[64]

#91 Scotland’s King James I was assassinated due to his love of tennis
The sewer drain near the corner of the court where King James I of Scotland played at Blackfriars Monastery kept dropping balls through it. This infuriated him, because what good is being king if you can’t order an unpleasant sewage drain to be blocked right away?

This, like so many other rash actions, came back to haunt James.

Assassins broke into his home a few days later to… assassinate him. The monarch sought to avoid the evil people by crawling beneath the floorboards and into the drainage system, intending to escape by the tennis court exit. Instead of a slew of tennis balls blocking the sewer drain he was running via, he discovered the newly blocked grate and was apprehended and killed.[65]

#92 The Wimbledon trophy is adorned with a tiny pineapple
The Wimbledon trophy has a pineapple on top of it that appears to symbolize the English habit of placing pineapples on their gateposts upon returning from a lengthy journey.[65]

#94 The fastest Grand Slam final ever was just 34 minutes

#93 In 2007 Wimbledon and the French Open organizers began awarding prize money to men and women equally
Wimbledon, along with the French Open, was the latest of the Grand Slam competitions to implement equal pay for men and women in 2007. Wimbledon, regarded as one of the most prominent tournaments on the circuit, did not implement equal prize money until 39 years after the ‘Open Era’ began in 1968.[66]

#95 Andre Agassi got reads on Boris Becker sticking his tongue out
During the prime of their careers, both of these players had a fierce tennis rivalry. Becker won the first three matches they played against each other three times in a row, a hat-trick of victories.

Agassi has no notion how he can beat Becker in a different way. He re-watched their matches on tape over and over. Before he served, he discovered Becker’s strange tendency. Becker would put his tongue out every time he was ready to serve. His serve would travel wide if it went to the left of his mouth; if it stayed in the centre, the ball would stay in the center.[66]

#96 In 2016, the Brazil Open tennis tournament replaced ball boys with stray dogs
In Brazil, four former street dogs are demonstrating their newfound abilities in 2016.

Frida, Costela, Mel, and Isabelle used to walk the streets of Sao Paulo, Brazil, but now they’re on assignment at the Brazil Open tennis event, according to the Associated Press.

The four canines worked as ball dogs during an exhibition match between Spain’s Roberto Carballes Baena and Portugal’s Gastao Elias. They wore orange ribbons and spent nearly 30 minutes during the practice match chasing wayward balls, after months of preparation.

The dogs’ participation encourages the adoption of abandoned street animals.[67]

#97 In 1993, 19-year-old Monica Seles was stabbed on court at the French Open
When Seles upset number one ranked Steffi Graf in the finals of the French Open in 1990, she became the youngest woman to win the tournament. Seles, a powerful player who has a reputation of grunting loudly during matches, took over as the top-ranked women’s player in 1991, replacing Graf.

She had won eight Grand Slam championships and was ranked number one in the world when she was attacked in 1993. Gunter Parche, 38, went over a fence and stabbed Seles between the shoulder blades with a knife on April 30, 1993, when she was seated on a courtside seat during a changeover in her match versus Magdalena Maleeva at the Hamburg Open. Security personnel swiftly caught Parche, and Seles was brought to the hospital.

Seles was able to heal from her physical injuries, but she was left with significant mental wounds and did not return to professional tennis for another two years.[68]

#98 A Grand Slam is when a player wins all four major championships in the same calendar year
In tennis, a Grand Slam is achieved when a player wins all four major championships in a single discipline in the same calendar year, sometimes known as a “Calendar-year Grand Slam” or “Calendar Slam.” In doubles, a team may win the Grand Slam by playing together, while an individual can win it by playing with different partners.

A “non-calendar-year Grand Slam” is defined as winning all four major championships in a row but not in the same calendar year, whereas a “Career Grand Slam” is defined as winning all four majors at any time during a career.[69]

#99 The word ‘tennis’ is believed to be from the French word ‘tenez,’ meaning ‘to take’
Tennis may have its origins as far back as the 12th century, according to one theory. When French monks played a courtyard game in which they struck a ball back and forth with their hands or off the courtyard walls, it is thought that they devised a forerunner to tennis. Jeu de Paume, or “Game of the Palm,” was the name given to this game. Those who accept this story also claim that the word “tennis” comes from these monks, who would cry “tenez” while serving the ball, which means “to take” in French.[70]
